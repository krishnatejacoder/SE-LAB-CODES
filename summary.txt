📌 2. Exposed Jenkins Publicly Using ngrok

To allow GitHub Webhooks to reach your local Jenkins.

You ran:

ngrok http 8085

ngrok generated:

https://kaliyah-unspellable-unanachronistically.ngrok-free.dev

This became your temporary public Jenkins URL.


---

📌 3. Created GitHub Webhook

In your GitHub repo → Settings → Webhooks:

You added:

https://kaliyah-unspellable-unanachronistically.ngrok-free.dev/github-webhook/

✔ Correct endpoint
✔ HTTPS
✔ Push event selected

Webhook successfully delivered events to Jenkins.


---

📌 4. Created a Jenkins Freestyle Job

Your job name (example):

MavenWeb_Build

Inside the job:

✔ Source Code Management (Git)

Repo URL set to:

https://github.com/krishnatejacoder/Smart-Assessment-Hub

✔ Build Trigger

Enabled:

GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling

✔ Build Steps

Used Maven build:

mvn clean install

Jenkins downloaded your repo, ran Maven, built the WAR file:

BUILD SUCCESS


---

📌 5. Confirmed Webhook Worked

Jenkins console showed:

Started by GitHub push
Triggering build...

Meaning:

GitHub → ngrok → Jenkins SUCCESS.


---

📌 6. Configured Jenkins Global Email (SMTP)

In:

Manage Jenkins → Configure System → E-mail Notification

You configured Gmail:

SMTP server: smtp.gmail.com
Port: 465
Use SSL: yes
Authentication: yes
Username: krishnadar05@gmail.com
Password: Gmail App Password

Test email:

✔ “Email was successfully sent”

SMTP 100% working.


---

📌 7. Added Build Emails to Job

In:

Post-build Actions

You added Editable Email Notification (emailext plugin).

Configured:

✔ Recipient = your Gmail
✔ Triggers:

Success

Failure

Unstable


Now Jenkins sends:

📩 Build SUCCESS
📩 Build FAILED
📩 Unstable build

You received the failure email (confirmed).

📌 8. Final Pipeline Achieved

✔ GitHub commit →

✔ Webhook triggers Jenkins →

✔ ngrok tunnels to local Jenkins →

✔ Jenkins fetches repo →

✔ Jenkins runs Maven →

✔ Creates .war file →

✔ Sends email notification (SUCCESS / FAILURE)
