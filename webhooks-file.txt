Step 1: Configure Jenkins to Receive Webhooks
1.1. Expose Jenkins to the Internet
GitHub needs to contact Jenkins using a public URL.
●	If Jenkins is already public (e.g., https://jenkins.example.com), skip this step.
●	If it’s local, use a tool like ngrok to generate a public URL, to be used as webhook endpoint. {Explained below}
Step 2: Create or Configure Your Jenkins Project
You can do this with either a Freestyle Project or a Pipeline.
Option A: Freestyle Project
1.	Go to Jenkins Dashboard → New Item → Freestyle project
2.	Under Source Code Management, choose Git
o	Enter your GitHub repo URL (e.g., https://github.com/user/repo.git)
o	Add credentials if the repo is private
3.	Under Build Triggers, check:
✅ “GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling”
4.	Add your build steps (shell commands, Maven, Gradle, etc.)
5.	Save the job.
Option B: Pipeline Project (Recommended)
1.	Go to Jenkins Dashboard → New Item → Pipeline
2.	Choose “Pipeline” and give it a name.
3.	Under Build Triggers, check:
✅ “GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling”
4.	Under Pipeline, select:
o	Definition: “Pipeline script from SCM”
o	SCM: “Git”
o	Enter your repo URL and branch (e.g., main)
5.	Save the job.
Step 3: Configure the Webhook on GitHub
1.	Go to your GitHub repository → Settings → Webhooks
2.	Click “Add webhook”
3.	Fill out the form:
o	Payload URL:  paste the url  - remaining all default values


NGROK
ngrok is a lightweight tool that lets you expose a local server to the public internet — securely and temporarily.
It creates a public HTTPS URL that tunnels directly to your localhost, so external services (like GitHub webhooks) can reach your Jenkins server running on your machine or private network. In simple terms it is like a “temporary public doorway” to your local Jenkins.
If your Jenkins runs at:			http://localhost:8085 
then, ngrok can generate a public URL like:	https://a1b2c3d4.ngrok.io
Now GitHub (or anyone) can reach your local Jenkins through that secure URL.
How ngrok works:
GitHub (Webhook)
   ↓
https://abcd1234.ngrok.io/github-webhook/
   ↓
Tunnel created by ngrok
   ↓
http://localhost:8080/github-webhook/
   ↓
Jenkins

How to Install and Use ngrok
Step 1. Download ngrok
https://ngrok.com/download
Download and extract it for your OS (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
Step 2. Connect Your ngrok Account (optional but useful)
After you sign up (free), ngrok gives you an auth token.
CREATE AUTHENTICATOR [https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken]
Run this command (replace <your_token> with yours):
ngrok config add-authtoken <your_token>
This ensures stable sessions and more control.
Step 3. Start a Tunnel for Jenkins
Assuming Jenkins runs locally on port 8085:
ngrok http 8085
You’ll see output like:
Session Status                online
Forwarding                    https://1234abcd.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8080
Copy the HTTPS URL (https://1234abcd.ngrok.io) — this is your public Jenkins URL for webhooks.
Step 4. Use it in GitHub Webhook
In your GitHub repo → Settings → Webhooks:
●	Payload URL: 		 [paste the url generated by ngrok]
https://1234abcd.ngrok.io/github-webhook/    [please include this – remaining all default]
Now, whenever you push code, GitHub sends an event to that URL, which ngrok forwards to your local Jenkins.
